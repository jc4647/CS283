1. How does the remote client determine when a command's output is fully received from the server, and what techniques can be used to handle partial reads or ensure complete message transmission?

The remote client determines when a command's output is fully received from the server by using techniques like delimiters and EOF markers. With these techniques, partial reads or complete message transmissions is ensured by allowing the client to detect when the entire response has been received. 

2. This week's lecture on TCP explains that it is a reliable stream protocol rather than a message-oriented one. Since TCP does not preserve message boundaries, how should a networked shell protocol define and detect the beginning and end of a command sent over a TCP connection? What challenges arise if this is not handled correctly?

A networked shell protocol defines and detects the beginning and end of a command sent over a TCP connection by using explicit delimiters. IF this is not handled correctly, then commands may be partially read or even misinterpreted.

3. Describe the general differences between stateful and stateless protocols.

Stateful protocols maintain session info between requests. Stateless protocols do not store past interactions.

4. Our lecture this week stated that UDP is "unreliable". If that is the case, why would we ever use it?

Even if UDP is "unreliable", it is still faster and more efficient than TCP for applications that require performance in real time.

5. What interface/abstraction is provided by the operating system to enable applications to use network communications?

Socket API.
